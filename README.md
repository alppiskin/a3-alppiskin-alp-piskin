## Your Watchlist

This is a watchlist application where you can log shows or movies you'd like to watch. Each entry has a name, a director, and a priority rating so you can remember what great piece of art to watch next when you have many on the list. Although this is an okay assignment, to my surprise, I really had fun learning and trying to polish this site. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I established login/register authentication and data persistence with MongoDB instead of local/lowdb
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Using around 8-10 Middleware packages
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Using bcrypt to hash passwords for privacy (this also encrypts the user password entries that can be viewed on MongoDB site)


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Compared to my older submissions, and also overall, the design of this app looks very clean. I have worked a lot on EJS and EJS layout to optimize my HTML structure, especially with tables and forms.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Using flash messages to create pretty pop-up alerts to the user for invalid login / registry ("Passwords don't match", "Email exists" etc.)
